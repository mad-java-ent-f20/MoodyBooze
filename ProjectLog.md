# Time Log

Week 1
* Caroline and Alisa reviewed deliverables and due dates to list out required tasks in the project plan
* Ying created a Maven project for the app
* Janak created an AWS instance for the project

Week 2
* Added User Stories
* Caroline used the random drink generator in the Cocktail DB to create some seed data for the database. Started to create database but having issues in Intellij not finding it. Planning to build the database on Friday, then give SQL to team so they can build local copies.
* Ying created on RestfulDao and start RestfulDaoTEst class(Still need to solve the test class to get the correct value from API instead of null with @Jsonignore)
* Caroline added .sql files to test/resources to create tables in moodybooze database and moodybooze_test. added content to cleandb.sql for refreshing the test database. I realized everyone will have to create and maintain their own database.properties file for connection to the test database because everyone's local password will be different.
